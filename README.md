# Chesston
This application extends the [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) library with a user interface. Start a game and join by entering the returned UUID of the black player in a second client. The player starting the game plays white. :joystick:

The game persists a page refresh by saving your player ID to the session storage. Each player ID is unique and connects to one game only. If you wish to play more than one game at once, simply start games in multiple tabs. Save your links to reconnect later.

The clock counts up and does not support fast chess.

The chess pieces are from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece). Replace the png files with custom ones if you wish to customize the board.

Apart from working on the architecture, these features could be next:

#### Next steps:
* Support of promotion (modal dialog).
* Numbers and letters around the board for better orientation.
* Input validation when joining a game.
* Player name display (maybe entered when starting or joining a game).
* Selection of color when starting a game.

#### Long-term roadmap:
* Statistic analysis of the game. This may build upon the already existing property _history_ of the game object. As of now, this property holds all moves performed in their correct order. The information attached to each move could however be extended and it may be questionable if this property has to be send with each move to the clients. It could be made available in a separate route upon request only.
* Gameplay on a single client when sitting at the same device.
* Single player mode against an AI.
* Board animations. This will require a replacement of the currently chosen approach of rendering the pieces as background images to the board squares.
* Refined page styling. Though I am fine with a clean default styling, the application has potential for a more customized look.

Feel free to contribute to this project if you want!
