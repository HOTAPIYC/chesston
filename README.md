# Chesston
This application extends the [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) library with a user interface. Start a game and join by entering the returned UUID of the black player in a second client. The player starting the game plays white. :joystick:

The frontend is developed in a separate project, with the production build files being included in the public folder.

#### Roadmap
* Improve project structure.
* Add AI player.

Feel free to contribute to this project if you want!
